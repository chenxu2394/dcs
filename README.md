# Frontend for a Digital Coins Store

## Description

This is an on-going frontend application for a digital coins store. It started as a simple e-commerce website which I built during my internship at Integrify.
The backend is a java application built with Spring Boot ([Repo here](https://github.com/chenxu2394/fs18_java_backend)). And the database is a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase.
